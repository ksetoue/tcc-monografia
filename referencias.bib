	abstract = "Abstract Cloud computing created many new opportunities for organisations across the world. Presently, Cloud services are available at affordable prices and accessible for all scales of businesses. The economic benefits of this wider acceptance to adopting Cloud computing are enormous and many companies have embraced Cloud computing now. Over the years, technology emergence has helped to enhance the growth of Cloud computing, but the growth had not been as per expectations in the beginning era of the Cloud computing. This paper analyzes various factors that have affected the adoption rate of Cloud computing to be slower than expectations. This paper also identifies that the major factor behind the slower growth of Cloud computing is the controversial view about Cloud computing in the eyes of \{IT\} workforce. Based on the result of a survey of \{IT\} workforce at various organizational levels, this paper establishes that the identified factors such as Cloud computing awareness and the fear of job loss in \{IT\} workforce played a role in slow adoption of Cloud computing. Further, this paper presents recommendations to handle technology adoption and forecasting in a better way in future. "
